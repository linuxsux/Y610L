  3) gcccore/.9.3.0   6) ucx/1.8.0          9) StdEnv/2020

Lmod is automatically replacing "intel/2020.1.217" with "gcc/9.3.0".


Due to MODULEPATH changes, the following have been reloaded:
  1) libfabric/1.10.1     2) openmpi/4.0.3     3) ucx/1.8.0

The environment has already been set by the module.
